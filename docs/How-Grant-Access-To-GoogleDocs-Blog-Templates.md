This guide describes how to grant access to blog post templates that are available in Google Docs in hpedev.hackshack@hpe.com google account.

1- One will have to watch out the hpedev.hackshack mbx on regular basis (once a day). Patrick and Frederic are checking the emails at least once a day.

2- Should a contributor request access to one of the blog post templates in Goggle docs, an email is sent to the hpedev.hackshack mbx. Title: "Share request for 'HPE DEV BASIC/TECHNICAL TUTORIAL BLOG ARTICLE TEMPLATE'

3- Before being able to grant access to the requested document in Google Docs, connect to Google Docs using hpedev.hackshack@hpe.com login account from your preferred browser.

4- From the request access email, click "Open" button, enter a short message and click Send button to notify the requestor that access to the requested file has been granted.

5- The requestor will then receive an email in his/her mailbox. Clicking on Open button will allow the contributor to access to the requested blog post template in his/her Google docs account, where he/she can go to "File" and "Pull Down" to make a copy of the template.
