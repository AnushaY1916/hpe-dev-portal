description: Are you a fan of HPE Developer? Become an HPE Developer Evangelist
  and help us spread the word on how developers, data scientists, and IT
  technologists can write applications and develop integrations for Hewlett
  Packard Enterprise enabled environments. As an HPE Developer Evangelist,
  you’ll be the primary HPE Developer contact for your region/country for
  colleagues, HPE partners and customers. You’ll forward communications to them,
  alerting them of upcoming meetups, Munch & Learn sessions and promoting the
  newest Workshops-on-Demand.

In open source land, you need to be fluent with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If it’s not the case yet, we recommend the following 3 part blog series:

* [Getting started with git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)
* [Sharing with the community](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-2-sharing-with-the-commun/)
* [Contributing back](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-3-contributing-back-to-th/)

We also have a Workshop-on-Demand which you can use to get hands-on experience with git. Feel free to register:

* [Getting started with git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)

Finally, starting with open source, means that you will either contribute to an existing project, or create your own project. We estimate that there are 200 millions packages on GitHub today, so finding the right place to engage is not that easy. If you are looking for a good project to contribute we suggest the following list (in alphabetical order):

| SPIFFE/SPIRE           | SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment) is a toolchain of APIs   for establishing trust between software systems across a wide variety of   hosting platforms. SPIRE exposes the SPIFFE Workload API, which can attest   running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn   allows two workloads to establish trust between each other, for example by   establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token.   SPIRE can also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a   database, or a cloud provider service. | https://github.com/spiffe                    |

If you want to create your own project, feel free to do so, and create a public repo for it. But if you are an HPE employee be aware that you have an open source review process to follow, before releasing any code to open source. Make sure you check this [HPE-only website](https://opensource.corp.hpecorp.net/osrp_process_upstream.html).

Last piece of advice. When joining an existing open source project in order to contribute, you will have to make yourself know to other contributors and maintainers. This might take time, be patient. Start small, by documenting issues in the code or in the documentation and proposing a solution. You can also review and comment on proposed changes. In most cases there will be a Slack or a glitter forum dedicated to the project, don’t hesitate to join and start discussion there. Once you name become associated with good feedback and proposal, it will be a lot easier for you to contribute code and get it approved and merged. 

And that’s when it get really exciting!
