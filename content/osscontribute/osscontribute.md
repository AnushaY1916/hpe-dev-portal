In the world of open source, you need to be fluent with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are not yet, we recommend you read the following 3 part blog series:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)
* [Sharing with the community](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-2-sharing-with-the-commun/)
* [Contributing back](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-3-contributing-back-to-th/)

We also offer a Workshop-on-Demand that you can take to get hands-on experience with git. Feel free to register by clicking below:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)

When you get started with open source, it means that you will either contribute to an existing project or create your own project. We estimate that there are 200 millions packages on GitHub today, so finding the right place to engage is not that easy. If you are looking for a good project to contribute to, we suggest the following list (in alphabetical order):

SmartSim launches ML infrastructure on HPC systems alongside user workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim        |
| Spark                  | Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data   processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL   and DataFrames, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine   learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.                                                                                               | https://github.com/apache/spark             |
| SPIFFE/SPIRE           | SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment) is a toolchain of APIs for establishing trust between software systems across a wide variety of hosting platforms. SPIRE exposes the SPIFFE Workload API, which can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. SPIRE can also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service. | https://github.com/spiffe                   |
| Zookeeper              | ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining   configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/apache/zookeeper         |

If you want to create your own project, feel free to do so and create a public repo for it. For HPE employees, be aware that there is an open source review process you need to follow before releasing any code to open source. Make sure you check this [HPE-only website](https://opensource.corp.hpecorp.net/osrp_process_upstream.html).

HPE has a number of contributors/maintainers that we have highlighted in a series of blog posts. Read about their respective journeys and join them in our Hall of Fame:

One last piece of advice. When joining an existing open source project in order to contribute, you will have to make yourself known to other contributors and maintainers. This might take time. Be patient. Start small, by documenting issues in the code or in the documentation and propose a solution. You can also review and comment on proposed changes. In most cases, there will be a Slack or a glitter forum dedicated to the project. Don’t hesitate to join and start discussion there. Once your name becomes associated with good feedback and proposals, it will be a lot easier for you to contribute code and get it approved and merged. 

And that’s when it gets really exciting! Enjoy the journey!
