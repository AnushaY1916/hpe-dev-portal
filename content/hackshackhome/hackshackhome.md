description: "26-October-2022: HPE combines the power and versatility of Apache
  Spark with the robust, enterprise-grade HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise to
  support running analytics at scale against large data sources. But what do you
  do once adoption scales to the point where dozens or hundreds of data
  scientists and data analysts are running massive amounts of Spark
  applications? In this talk, we’ll learn how HPE is partnering with Pepperdata
  to bring detailed observability via Pepperdata’s Platform and Application
  Spotlight, and more importantly, deliver automated, near real-time, autonomous
  optimization of cluster container resources via Pepperdata’s Capacity
  Optimizer, without the need for Spark developers to change a single line of
  code."
