description: "26-October-2022: In this talk, we’ll learn how HPE is partnering
  with Pepperdata to bring detailed observability via Pepperdata’s Platform and
  Application Spotlight, and more importantly, deliver automated, near
  real-time, autonomous optimization of cluster container resources via
  Pepperdata’s Capacity Optimizer, without the need for Spark developers to
  change a single line of code."
