description: Join us for a free, 60-minute session where you can connect with
  experts who offer valuable insights into todayâ€™s most popular technologies.
  This month, meet with Brad Chamberlain, HPE, who will discuss the Chapel
  parallel programming language, pioneered by Cray and HPE. Chapel supports
  parallel programs that are similarly readable/writable as Python while
  providing performance and portability similar to Fortran, C, C++, and other
  common techniques for writing parallel and/or scalable code. Brad will also
  describe an open-source Python library written in Chapel that uses parallelism
  to accelerate common NumPy and Pandas operations used in data science.
