The HPE Ezmeral portfolio of software products provides businesses with the foundation needed to develop analytic applications across hybrid-cloud environments. HPE Ezmeral lets you seamlessly access, manage and govern all your data, regardless of where it is located, and combine it into a single view. Combined with our open-source analytics framework that allows your developers to use the tools of their choice, high-performance analytics can be delivered at enterprise scale with an overall lower TCO.

In addition to the existing portfolio of products, HPE is constantly researching and developing new capabilities, features, and products. The HPE Ezmeral Early Access beta program allows your developers to try these new products before they’re released. With exemplary training and support provided by the HPE Ezmeral Product Management team, your developers will get hands-on experience with new features and capabilities. They’ll also be able to provide regular feedback based on their hands-on activities, helping to guide the product roadmap and ensure new and exciting products are being developed and released on a regular basis.
