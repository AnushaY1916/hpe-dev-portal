Data science is an intriguing field, and recognition of its potential is rapidly expanding. But there are challenges. You need access to the right data and the flexibility to use a variety of tools of your own choice. The pipeline for data preparation and for model and application deployment needs to be reliable and efficient. And you need to increase the likelihood that stakeholders and IT managers will green-light new projects.

On this page, we provide a range of content – for advanced data scientists to those just getting started – to help you meet these challenges. You will find a rotating selection of foundational material, ideas to help you get inspired, as well as practical tips on key issues that help make your data science projects easier to build and more likely to be successful. You’ll also learn what Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) offers. 

The roles of the Data/ML Engineer and Data Scientist can overlap. You may also find content of interest to you on the Data/ML Engineer page. Content on this page changes as new material becomes available or new topics arise, so check back regularly. Feel free to ping us on [Slack](https://slack.hpedev.io/) with your comments, questions, and requests for information.

    ### Get Inspired
    **A sampler of new ideas related to data/ML engineering:**

    *Learn how industry innovation may affect your job.*

    - Unit testing isn’t just for code: you need to unit test your data. [Watch Deequ: Unit Tests for Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f_JewK79GI)

    - Innovative architectures help in geo-distributed systems where it’s better to distribute learning rather than moving data. Read this technical paper from HPE AI Labs [Swarm Learning: Turn Your Distributed Data into Competitive Edge](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/pdfViewer.html?docId=a50000344&parentPage=/us/en/products/compute/hpc/deep-learning&resourceTitle=Swarm+Learning:+Turn+Your+Distributed+Data+into+Competitive+Edge+technical+white+paper)

    *Domain expertise, including expert knowledge of business or technical fields, is essential to building data science projects that actually deliver value. It is needed to frame questions, identify what data is useful and plan what actions will be taken to put insights to work.*
    
    - Combining diverse data sets leads to advances in fighting disease. Watch the on-demand presentation [Data Saves Lives](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/discover-more-network/events/discover-2021/results.html/types/sessions/search/b4372?media-id=/us/en/resources/discover/las-vegas-2021/B4372/_jcr_content.details.json)

    - Combined stakeholder expertise – from data scientists to small-holding farmers – can put advanced agricultural knowledge to work in the field - literally. Watch the on-demand presentation [Data Feeds People](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/discover-more-network/events/discover-2021/results.html/types/sessions/search/b4373).

    ### Building a Foundation 
    **Get maximum flexibility for your choice of tools**

    *The right data infrastructure should give you direct access to data via a wide range of APIs for flexibility in your choice of tools.*

    - Study the technical paper [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric: Modern infrastructure for data storage and management](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a00110846enw)

    - View the [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric platform ](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-ezmeral-data-fabric/home/) page

    **Containerization of applications**

    *Containerized applications can be orchestrated with the open source Kubernetes framework.*

    - Read [Kuberneticized machine learning and AI using Kubeflow](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/kubernetized-machine-learning-and-ai-using-kubeflow/)

    - Learn how management of large scale Kubernetes clusters is made easier with [HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-ezmeral-runtime/home/)

### Addressing Key Concerns

## How do I find and get access to the right data?

- Read [Avoiding pitfalls: Tips for better data science](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/Avoiding-pitfalls-Tips-for-better-data-science/ba-p/7144228)

- Better connections between data producers and data consumers make data science more successful. Check out [Getting value from your data shouldn’t be this hard](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/getting-value-from-your-data-shouldn-t-be-this-hard-2106.html)

**What can I do to lower the entry barriers to developing new AI/ML/data science projects?**

- AI/ML projects can and should be run on the same system as analytics projects: Read “Chap 3: AI and Analytics Together” in the free eBook [AI and Analytics at Scale: Lessons from Real-World Production Systems](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/software/ai-and-analytics-systems.html)

- Read [2nd project advantage: lowering barriers to AI and machine learning](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/Second-project-advantage-Lowering-barriers-to-AI-and-machine/ba-p/7154034#.YZYX2elKhE4)

**How do I optimize data logistics and preparation efforts to keep them from overwhelming the data science project?**

- Read [Budgeting time for AI/ML projects](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/Budgeting-time-for-AI-ML-projects/ba-p/7090807#.YZYZVelKhE4)

- See content for the [Data/ML Engineer role](#)

**What makes it easier to deal with edge computing in large-scale systems?**

- Read [To the edge and back again: Meeting the challenges of edge computing](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/To-the-edge-and-back-again-Meeting-the-challenges-of-edge/ba-p/7132609#.Ya5X3r3ML0o)

 

**How do I ensure data trust and security?**

- Learn about the [SPIFFE and SPIRE projects](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/spiffe-and-spire-projects/home/) that are hosted by the CNCF Foundation

 

**How are others doing this?**
