Every software developer, computer programmer, software engineer, and coder shares the same goal: to create the best software for customers. This involves user experience, security, serviceability, and reusability, as well as commercial success. In addition to knowing the languages and tools at your disposal, it also requires an understanding of your deployment model - considering the teams in place, the corporate context and the delivery mechanism. And in this quickly evolving environment, it’s not always easy to keep up.

Here, we cover the latest software trends, new programming languages, and new techniques and methodologies to help you improve the way you build software for your customers – whether it’s through open source projects or commercial offerings. 

The role of the Developer may overlap with other roles like the [Data-driven Developer](https://developer.hpe.com/role/data-driven-developer/home/) or even the [Data Scientist](https://developer.hpe.com/role/data-scientist/home/). On this page, we focus on developers who build the applications that generate data, which Data Scientists can use to support business outcomes.
