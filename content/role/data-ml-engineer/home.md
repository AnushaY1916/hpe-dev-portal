It’s your job to ensure the right data powers the right applications at the right time and in the right place.

With an increased number and variety of workloads, how can you address all aspects of data logistics and processing that can make or break the success of any data-intensive project, including analytics and AI/machine learning? And do it easily and reliably?

On this page, we provide content to help you meet these challenges. You will find a rotating selection of foundational material, ideas to help you get inspired, as well as practical tips on key issues to improve efficiency and performance. You’ll also learn what Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) offers.

The roles of the Data/ML Engineer and Data Scientist can overlap. You may also find content of interest to you on the [Data Scientist](https://deploy-preview-896--hpe-dev-portal.netlify.app/role/data-scientist/home/) page. Content on this page changes as new material becomes available or new topics arise, so check back regularly. Feel free to ping us on [Slack](https://slack.hpedev.io/) with your comments, questions, and requests for information.

### Addressing Key Concerns

**What can I do to lower the entry barriers to developing new AI/ML/data science projects?**

- AI/ML projects can and should be run on the same system as analytics projects: Read “Chapter 3: AI and Analytics Together” in the free eBook [AI and Analytics at Scale: Lessons from Real-World Production Systems](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/software/ai-and-analytics-systems.html)

 

**How do I handle data movement?**

- Read [A better approach to major data motion: built-in data mirroring](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/A-better-approach-to-major-data-motion-Efficient-built-in/ba-p/7135056#.Ya5Xqb3ML0p)

- Watch the webinar [Data Motion at Scale: the Untold Story](https://www.hpe.com/h22228/video-gallery/us/en/5a1ff1b7-faf8-43f2-98a3-d5b7331616b6/video?jumpid=em_4pbhacrk27_aid-520049397&utm_source=RE)

**What makes it easier to deal with edge computing in large-scale systems?**

- Read [To the edge and back again: Meeting the challenges of edge computing](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/To-the-edge-and-back-again-Meeting-the-challenges-of-edge/ba-p/7132609#.Ya5X3r3ML0o)

 

**How do I ensure data trust and security?**

- New approaches are improving the connection between data producers and data consumers. See how in the video [Dataspaces: connecting to data you can trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VTLA1nxpoo)

- Learn about the [SPIFFE and SPIRE projects](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/spiffe-and-spire-projects/home/) that are hosted by the CNCF Foundation
