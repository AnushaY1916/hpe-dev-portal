### Golden Age of AI, Dark Ages of AI Infrastructure

February 16, 2022

This month, meet with Neil Conway, senior director of engineering Determined AI at HPE and learn why practical use of deep learning (DL) remains difficult, what problems DL infrastructure tools solve today, where they fall short, and how they can improve. This talk draws on academic work done at Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, and UCLA, as well as experiences at Determined AI, a startup recently acquired by HPE and that builds open-source software to make deep learning engineers dramatically more productive.
