## HPE DEV Meetups

### Quarkus - Supersonic Subatomic Java

January 26, 2022 5.00 pm Central European Time

Java based software development has been a winning proposition for the past 20+ years, however, cloud native application development in the form of microservices and serverless apps are challenging the Java deployment model in terms of memory requirements and start up speed. Quarkus is a Kubernetes native Java stack that can tailor your application for Hotspot and AOT native compilation providing amazingly fast boot times and incredibly low RSS memory usage, making Java great again in a Cloud Native Universe.



Quarkus has already completed 2.5 year as a community project and an increasing number of developers are rediscovering true developer joy moving to Quarkus and putting applications into production. Come to this talk to get an introduction to Quarkus as we explain what makes it special. We'll also provide a glimpse of the things that are coming, to help you plan your path forward and join the Quarkus revolution!
