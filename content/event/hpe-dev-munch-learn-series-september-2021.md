## HPE DEV Munch & Learn series

Digital Transformation.Next: Data & Analytics Workloads

September 22, 2021

The HPE DEV monthly Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where you can listen to and engage with leading technology experts who offer valuable insights into today’s most popular technologies. A different topic is presented each month. For our September session, Randy Thomasson and Matt Maccaux will discuss where many of these organizations are today and where they want to go (hint: something cloud), but don’t really know how to get there. The discussion will weave bits of strategic best practices and practical architectural details.
