## HPE DEV Munch & Learn series

### The Great Unification: Building Analytic pipelines with Apache Spark

November 17, 2021

The HPE DEV monthly Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where you can listen to and engage with leading technology experts who offer valuable insights into today’s most popular technologies. A different topic is presented each month. For our November session, Matt Hausmann will discuss today’s modern, data-driven industry and how HPE leads the way with the Unified Analytics platform. Matthew Morris will enumerate the performance benefits gained when paired with industry-leading hardware acceleration from NVIDIA. Finally, Don Wake will demonstrate an Apache 3 Spark workflow running on HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise, using HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric to extract value from data in a Lakehouse, on-premises infrastructure.
