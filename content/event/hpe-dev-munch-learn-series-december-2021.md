## HPE DEV Munch & Learn series

### Redfish: Past, Present and Future

December 8, 2021

The HPE DEV Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where you can listen to and engage with leading technology experts who offer valuable insights into today’s most popular technologies. A different topic is presented each month. For our December session, Jeff Hilland, DMTF President, will discuss how Redfish got started (did you know it is an HPE invention?), where it is now in HPE & the industry and the scope of where Redfish is going now and in the future. It will also cover the technologies that enable HPE development to support devices inside the platform with little to no additional development. Finally, François Donzé will demonstrate HPE iLOrest, a powerfull command line Redfish client.
