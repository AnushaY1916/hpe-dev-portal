## Munch & Learn series

### Chapel: Making parallel computing as easy as Py(thon), from laptops to supercomputers

April 20, 2022

Join us for a free, 60-minute session where you can connect with experts who offer valuable insights into todayâ€™s most popular technologies. This month, meet with Brad Chamberlain, HPE, who will discuss the Chapel parallel programming language, pioneered by Cray and HPE. Chapel supports parallel programs that are similarly readable/writable as Python while providing performance and portability similar to Fortran, C, C++, and other common techniques for writing parallel and/or scalable code. Brad will also describe an open-source Python library written in Chapel that uses parallelism to accelerate common NumPy and Pandas operations used in data science.
