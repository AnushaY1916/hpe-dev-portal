## CHIUW 2022

### The 9th Annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop

June 09-10, 2022

CHIUW 2022 is the 9th annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop, which serves as a forum where users and developers of the Chapel programming language (chapel-lang.org) can meet to report on work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new collaborations. Anyone interested in parallel programming and Chapel is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those simply curious to learn more. This year's CHIUW will be online and there will be no registration fees.
