### Styra - Decoupled policy enforcement with Open Policy Agent



April 27, 2022



In just a few years, the CNCF graduated Open Policy Agent (OPA) project has established itself as the de-facto standard for policy based guard rails around Kubernetes clusters - now it’s moving into microservices! In this talk, we’ll explore the benefits of decoupling policy from application logic, and how OPA can help bring order to an increasingly distributed, heterogeneous, and complex tech stack.
