### Styra - Decoupled policy enforcement with Open Policy Agent



April 27, 2022



In just a few years, the CNCF graduated Open Policy Agent (OPA) project, has established itself as the de-facto standard for policy based guard rails around kubernetes clusters - now it’s moving into our microservices! In this talk we’ll explore the benefits of decoupling policy from application logic, and how OPA can help bring order to an increasingly distributed, heterogeneous and complex tech stack.
