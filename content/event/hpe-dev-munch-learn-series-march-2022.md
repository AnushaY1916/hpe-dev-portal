March 23, 2022



Join us for a free, 60-minute session where you can connect with experts who offer valuable insights into todayâ€™s most popular technologies. This month, meet with Mithril engineering team at HPE who will discuss the fundamentals of zero trust,  workload identities, and introduce the concept of Service Mesh. They will then explain how the new open source solution, Mithril, leverages the widely adopted Service Mesh solution Istio, and the secure identities framework of SPIRE to secure the Istio Service Mesh.
