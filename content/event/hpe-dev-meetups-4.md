Today, natural language processing (NLP) powers the latest conversational AI and translation apps. Join us to explore the collaborative experimentation process that machine learning teams leverage and the challenges they face while training these large-scale NLP models. See how Determinedâ€™s open-source deep learning training platform helps model developers train models faster and easier using tools such as resource management, fault tolerance, and model optimization.
