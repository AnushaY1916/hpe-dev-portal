description: Have I got a scoop for you! HPE just announced the HPE Container Platform, the industry’s first enterprise-grade Kubernetes-based container platform that enables true hybrid cloud operations across any location. The HPE Container Platform is key to the HPE DEV focus on simplifying and modernizing applications. Read more about it in this and subsequent newsletters. We’re also excited to feature posts on recent events the HPE DEV team attended, a cool tutorial on how to create a facial recognition app, and, last but not least, another Meet the Team video.
