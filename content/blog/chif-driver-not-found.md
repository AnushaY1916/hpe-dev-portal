## Introduction

When using the [HPE RESTful Interface Tool](http://hpe.com/info/resttool) (iLOrest) or other applications like the Update Manager ([SUM](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/smart-update.html)) or the integrated Smart Update Tool ([iSUT](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-a00068223en_us)) you may get the error `Chif driver not found, please check that the chif driver is installed` without any other tip to identify the origin of the problem or to fix it. This article attempts to explain when this error occurs and why.
