Customers across industries are struggling with the complexity of managing data and infrastructure, because it creates a roadblock to innovation and agility. Today, every organization is required to unleash the power of data to drive digital transformation, but fragmented data management tools, manual processes, and infrastructure silos - spanning edge to cloud - are getting in the way. This complexity also amplifies business risk, and it's only getting harder as data continues to grow, apps evolve, and infrastructure continues its spread from edge to cloud. 


Data Services Cloud Console public REST API provides a resource for customers who are looking to enhance their infrastructure management and data-ops using the programmatic extensions from Data Services Cloud Console (DSCC).
