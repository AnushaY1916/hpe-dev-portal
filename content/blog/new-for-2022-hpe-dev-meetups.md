The HPE DEV team is happy to announce another series of technology talks for 2022 called HPE DEV Meetups. These sessions will complement the HPE DEV [Munch & Learn series](https://developer.hpe.com/campaign/munch-and-learn) that were started in 2021 and will continue throughout 2022.

The HPE DEV Munch & Learns were designed to provide high-level insights on different technologies. They proved quite successful with a grand total of 1,415 participants attending the 11 sessions that were held this past year. Participants indicated that, while they enjoyed and wished to continue these sessions, an option to dive more deeply to fully explore specific projects or products was also necessary. These HPE DEV Meetups are designed to fill that gap, covering topics that sit at the intersection of development and open source. The cadence for these meetups will be monthly, occurring on the last week of each month.

The first meetup will be held on January 26th, 5PM CET (8AM PST). This first session is entitled **Quarkus - Supersonic Subatomic Java** and delivered by **Dimitris Andreadis**, Engineering Director at Red Hat. After that, we will have a session on February 23rd on **Streamlit - the fastest way to build and share data science apps.** This session will bedelivered by **Arnaud Miribel**, machine learning engineer at Streamlit.io. As you can see, we are already off to a good start and will continue look for the best possible speakers inside and outside of HPE to cover the most relevant topics for developers and open source enthusiasts.

Please check our new HPE DEV [Meetup calendar page](https://developer.hpe.com/campaign/meetup) for the complete list of our meetup registration links. We will also post replay links there once they are available. We hope you will join us to continue to expand your skills and expertise.
