## Introduction
As one of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services, *HPE GreenLake for Containers* is an HPE-designed, implemented, owned, and operated private cloud that is built on HPE Ezmeral Container Platform, based on open source Kubernetes, and deployed at a customer site. In HPE GreenLake for Containers, it configures to use a gateway host, acting as a proxy sever, that carries client requests from deployed application service endpoints in the Kubernetes clusters. The gateway host maps the private IP endpoints of services running inside the Kubernetes clusters to external accessible IP addresses and ports. It provides better security by exposing only the gateway host IP address to the external while keeping all the others behind the firewall. However, when you create your application from Docker image, your application pods may get stuck in the error state *`ErrImagePull`*. Below is a sample `ngnix` application deployment and the received error message in the pod events:

```
$ kubectl run cfe-nginx --image=nginx
pod/cfe-nginx created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
cfe-nginx   0/1     ErrImagePull   0          5s


$ kubectl describe pods cfe-nginx 
Name:         cfe-nginx
...

```
Above issue is caused by [Docker policy changes for downloading images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/). In particular, for anonymous users, the image download rate limit is set to 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address. No matter who starts creating a new application from Docker image, the Kubernetes cluster downloads the image as an anonymous user, which counts toward the new rate limit on the same gateway host IP. Given that other developers are using the same Kubernetes cluster, together with many *ArgoCD* jobs configured to run in the backend, the limit can be eventually reached and the *`ErrimagePull`* message pops up.



This article walks through the process of setting up credentials of your Docker subscription in the Kubernetes cluster. The cluster then uses it to authenticate to your Docker account and pull the image as an authenticated user. The image download will count against individual limit of your Docker subscription instead of the 100 downloads shared across all anonymous cluster users.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following credentials of your Docker subscription, either personal or a paid one: 

-	Docker Username
-	Docker Password or Access Token

Note that the Docker access token instead of Docker password would be recommended to be used as the credentials. You can refer to [Dockerâ€™s Manage Access Tokens page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) to create such an access token of your Docker subscription. Docker access token provides some advantages over the password. It can't be used for performing any admin activity on your Docker account, and it provides a way to check the last usage and it can be easily disabled or deleted. In case you have two-factor authentication setup on your account, using the access token is the only way to authenticate to Docker.

The personal Docker subscription credentials allow you to log in to Docker as an authenticated user in which the image rate limit is set to 200 pulls per 6 hour period. The users with a paid Docker subscription have no limits in image downloads. It could make sense to have a paid Docker subscription at team or company level. However you do not really need to upgrade your Docker account to a paid one. 200 pulls per 6 hours period as an authenticated user should be enough for an individual developer to work on application deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.




## Setup Details

### Create a Registry Secret 
You can use the following command to create a registry secret using your Docker credentials:

```
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry cfe-registry-key --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<password> --docker-email=<email>
```
The option `--docker-email` is optional. `cfe-registry-key` is the sample secret name used in the setup process.

You can verify the registry secret has been created:
```
$ kubectl get secrets cfe-registry-key 
NAME               TYPE                             DATA   AGE
cfe-registry-key   kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      2m11s
```

### Specify `imagePullSecrets` on Pods
You can create pods or update existing ones to refer to the created registry secret by adding the following `imagePullSecrets` section to Pod definition:

```json
imagePullSecrets:
- name: cfe-registry-key
```

With those pod manifest files, the Kubernetes cluster downloads the image as an authenticated user using the credentials from the registry secret. The image download will not count against the 100 download limit shared across all anonymous cluster users in the Kubernetes cluster. 

Although it works for most of your application deployment, it requires to modify manifest files to add `imagePullSecrets` section. 

You can use the following step to add image pull secret to `service accounts`. When you try to create new applications, the `imagePullSecrets` will be automatically injected and used in downloading the images. The setup makes sense especially when you have the paid Docker subscription. Other developers use the same Kubernetes cluster can benefit the setup to have unlimited image download in their application deployment.




### Add `imagePullSecrets` to Service Accounts
You can run the following command to modify the default service account for the namespace to use `imagePullSecrets`:

```





$ kubectl patch serviceaccount default -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "cfe-registry-key"}]}'

serviceaccount/default patched
```
you can verify the `imagePullSecrets` section has been added to the service account:
```


$ kubectl get serviceaccount default -o yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:

  name: default
...
...
imagePullSecrets:
- name: cfe-registry-key
```
When you try to create a pod in the current namespace, you can verify the pod has its `sepc.imagePullSecrets` field set automatically:

```


$ kubectl run cfe-nginx --image=nginx 
pod/cfe-nginx created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cfe-nginx   1/1     Running   0          4m28s


$ kubectl get pod cfe-nginx -o=jsonpath='{.spec.imagePullSecrets[0].name}{"\n"}'
cfe-registry-key
```
If you deploy application to a different namespace than the current one, you need run the command `kubectl patch serviceaccount` with the additional option `-n <namespace>` to add `imagePullSecrets` to the default service account in the new namespace. 

Similarly, if you deploy application to a namespace using a different service account than the default one, you need replace `default` in the command `kubectl patch serviceaccount`  with the service account name to add `imagePullSecrets` to this service account. By default, deploying application to a namespace uses the default service account. You can define the `serviceAccountName` in your manifest files to change the service account you want to use.

## Conclusion
Docker's image download rate limit has caused quite a few confusion in HPE GreenLake for Containers. This article describes you how to set up the registry secret using credentials of your Docker subscription to pull images for your application deployment. Once follow up the procedure, your application deployment will be able to download images without hitting any more the rate limit error.
