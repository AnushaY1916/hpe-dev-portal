Data Service Cloud Console provides public REST APIs so that users can manage their infrastructure programmatically. To enhance this experience, Software Development Kits(SDK) are useful.  Before we go into SDK, letâ€™s understand the difference between an Application Programming Interface (API) and an SDK. 

APIs are a list of function libraries that are used to communicate with a web service (via secure HTTP), whereas an SDK is a development kit that facilitates the usage of these APIs. APIs enable any software developer to create business opportunities by leveraging the capabilities provided by the API to extend their application whereas the SDK facilitates the process for developers. An SDK is a collection of software tools and programs for a specific application platform that allows developers to manipulate the functions supported by the service. These can be considered as a wrapper on the top of the APIs, making the code consumable by the application.
