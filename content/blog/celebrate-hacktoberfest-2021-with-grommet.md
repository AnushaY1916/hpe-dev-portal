It’s that time of the year again… the leaves are falling, the pumpkins are ripe, and developers once again get to participate in Hacktoberfest – a month-long celebration run by Digital Ocean that encourages contributions to open source projects. Coders are rewarded for their participation. This year, if you make 4 contributions during the month of October to open source projects you can earn a limited edition T-shirt or opt to help save the planet by having a tree planted in your name.

Grommet contributors have traditionally participated heavily in this event and it looks like it’s going to be another great event. In just the first week of Hacktoberfest, the Grommet team saw 22 Pull Requests come in, including a number of pull requests coming from first time contributors. Congratulations, and welcome to the Grommet community!

**What are Grommet contributors focusing on this year?**

This year, coders have been heavily focused on Typescript, working on an issue that has recently gotten a lot of attention. A lot of progress has already been made in converting our unit tests to Typescript, which improves our type definitions. There’s a really good chance we’re going to come out of this Hacktoberfest with a much more Typescript-friendly experience for Grommet users.

We’ve also seen some great collaboration going on in the repository. Community contributors are helping review each other’s pull requests, submitting issues, making suggestions for improvement, and helping answer questions. While these types of contributions don’t necessarily count towards the 4 pull requests needed to win a prize, this sort of assistance is greatly appreciated by everyone in the community and helps make it a more friendly, collaborative space.

**There’s still time to participate!**

Haven’t had a chance to check it out yet? There’s still a few weeks left before the end of the month. All you need to do is register on the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) site to link your Github account and track your contributions. To contribute to Grommet, simply take a look at issues labeled [‘hacktoberfest’](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest) on Grommet’s repository.

We welcome contributions from any skill level. There are a variety of issues to pick from. You can even contribute to issues that don’t have the [‘hacktoberfest’](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest) label, as they will still count. If you are a first time contributor check out our [contribution guide](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and keep an eye out for issues labeled [‘good first issue’](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). 

Happy Hacking!
