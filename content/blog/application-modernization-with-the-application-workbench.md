One of the most significant issues facing enterprises in their journey towards digital transformation is the challenge of application modernization. Did you know that 70% of the Global IT budget is spent on legacy application maintenance?  In fact, 7 in 10 companies today struggle with legacy application maintenance while they tackle their digital transformation. Consider how counterproductive it is to spend that much time, energy, and money on something that doesn’t really help them move forward.

In this post, I’ll discuss the different approaches one can take to modernize an application and how the HPE Ezmeral Application Workbench can help.

## What is Application Modernization? 

Application modernization is the process of taking legacy applications and the platforms they run on and making them new again by replacing or updating each with modern features and capabilities.  It includes changing the underlying application architecture from a monolithic to a distributed model by taking the advantage of the integration and automation implicit in DevOps practices. It also often means that the architecture and source code are updated through the use of modern programming languages in order to support containers and microservices and can take advantage of built-in security and storage features.

One could equate application modernization to updating the design of a car. For instance, if you were to compare a vintage 1967 Ford Mustang to a modern 2021 version, the 1967 would not have disk brakes, ABS, fuel injection, air bags, shoulder belts, crush zones and all the other things that make it a modern, safe, reliable, and economical car. 

Truly, there is very little you can do to a 1967 Mustang to bring it up to the standards of a 2021 car. To transform it, you would need to change the 1967 car’s base architecture. Another option would be to completely replace the older car with a different brand that boasts a modern architecture, like Tesla. But that would probably change a lot about how you drive. If you happen to like Ford and want to stick with it because you’re familiar with how their cars work, that approach may not work well for you.

This same idea applies to modernizing software applications. You cannot simply update the underlying compute and storage infrastructure and expect an application to automatically behave as if it had modern features. An application that was built for a mainframe environment is very different from applications that are built today, applications that are optimized for distributed environments and developed through the use of DevOps practices. To have an application work efficiently and securely across hybrid clouds, it needs to be modernized.

## The Challenges of Modernizing Legacy Apps 

Enterprises face a variety of challenges as they address application modernization, such as: 
- Isolating applications from their infrastructure is often a very time consuming and manual process.
- Legacy, monolithic systems are not designed with distributed hardware in mind and are difficult to break apart.
- Legacy apps lack security integrations.
- They also lack tight DevOps integration.
- Lastly, budget and cost control are difficult to estimate, as well as difficult to test and consolidate amongst legacy applications.

There are different approaches one can use to migrate legacy applications into modern architectures. Most of these solutions are offered in the [HPE Ezmeral Container Platform](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/container-platform.html) along with the [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/data-fabric.html). Depending on the customer use case, application, cost, and time requirements, HPE can help to smooth the way in this journey.
