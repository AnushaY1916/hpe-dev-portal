It was standing-room only when HPE’s CEO, Antonio Neri, gave his [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YocxnhKAnM) to kick off the HPE Discover 2022 Edge-to-Cloud Conference. The importance of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform resounded everywhere throughout the event. But most exciting for us was when the newly refreshed HPE Developer Community portal was shown on the onstage screen. You could hear a large cheer as Antonio noted the importance of developers to HPE, specifically in relation to the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, and mentioned the HPE Developer Community by name.

In his [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YocxnhKAnM), Antonio Neri announced the availability of the new HPE GreenLake Developer portal – along with new tools – created with the aim of making it easier for developers to access Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for HPE GreenLake. By previewing this portal, Antonio showed how HPE is working to engage with developers, IT DevOps teams, and data engineers to help them harness data and facilitate its use enterprise-wide to inform business decision making.

It was a proud moment for the team – and an important one as we expand the HPE Developer Community’s ability to help developers of all types engage on the HPE GreenLake platform.

## Develop with the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform

Antonio emphasized that bringing a consistent cloud operating model across all workloads and data was the real answer to the conundrum businesses face when they ask which workloads should be put in a public cloud and which should stay on-premises. And this is where HPE GreenLake provides the solution. It’s a platform build specifically for a highly distributed enterprise designed for application modernization.

But it’s also important to remember that HPE GreenLake is a platform for application development. He pointed out that HPE is continuing to build out its growing GreenLake partner ecosystem with distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, ISVs, and service providers. “We are placing partner capabilities at the center of our platform through our strategy to open our unique APIs to partners,” Neri told the audience. “They can choose to build, resell or manage on behalf of the customers.”

Antonio highlighted that HPE has already shown its GreenLake API partner commitment by announcing tight API integration with the cloud marketplaces of the top four global distributors – TD Synnex, Ingram Micro, Arrow Electronics and ALSO Group – making it easier for them to sell cloud services through and with the channel. Ultimately, the aim is to open the full power of the platform to partners.

## Looking forward to next Discover

Traditionally, the HPE Discover event has been an event where customers and partners get key insights into HPE’s strategies and products. In recent years, it has attracted more business line managers than techies. As our strategy continues to evolve to a cloud software and services model, the important issues that will be discussed will be how to integrate with the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Developers take heed! This is your moment. Start talking with your managers now to make sure they budget for your ability to travel and hear what’s new at the next HPE Discover event!
