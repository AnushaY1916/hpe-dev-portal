In October of 2020, the HPE DEV team introduced a **very easy** way for users to learn about a variety of different software topics by interacting with code virtually – in the form of **free** HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand. Starting with just three workshops, the program has continued to grow and now offers over 20 courses, ranging from basic coding 101 to sophisticated infrastructure automation.

These hands-on workshops cover a variety of [topics](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops), including open source technologies (i.e. Kubernetes, SPIFFE/SPIRE, Grommet), popular programming languages (i.e. Python, RUST, StackStorm), coding tools (i.e. APIs, Git), and market-leading HPE technologies (i.e. HPE Ezmeral Container Platform and Data Fabric). Whether it’s due to the popularity of these topics, the workshop’s unique, easy-to-follow methodology, the associated badge recognition program, or the fact that they’re free – these workshops have certainly gained quite a lot of interest!

 

**Measuring success**

The goal of the HPE DEV program is to foster a community where members can innovate through shared experiences, collaboration, and learning. As just one of the services HPE DEV offers to the developer community, the Workshops-on-Demand program is an important one that fits these goals very nicely. Every so often we take stock of our programs to determine how much value each one offers so we can make any necessary adjustments. And, as the program manager for the HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand, it really falls on me to make that determination.

From my standpoint, rocketing from offering 3 to now over 20 workshops during the course of a year could easily be seen as success. But from a participant‘s side, it might be different. So what data should be considered a good measure of success for this program?

I decided to analyze a few data points from different categories that appeared to provide some important insights:

*  Participants:

  *  Number of attendees
  * Type of attendees (including HPE employees, partners, customers)
  * Completed workshop surveys
* Content:

  * Number of workshops produced
  * Topics covered
* Infrastructure:

  * Resiliency of the platform
  * Accessibility
