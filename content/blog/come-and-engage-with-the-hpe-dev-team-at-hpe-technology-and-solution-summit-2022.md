Today, more and more purchasing decisions related to software, including cloud-based initiatives, are being influenced by developers and data scientists. The hands-on engagement opportunities HPE DEV offers at events like the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) [Technology Solutions Summit 2022](https://h41382.www4.hpe.com/tss/) (TSS 2022) helps build a collaborative, open discussion where we can each learn from each other to address today's challenges with innovative (and often rather fun) methods.

If you're one of the lucky ones in the HPE and HPE partner presales community who can take advantage of HPE's largest and most comprehensive technical and solutions knowledge transfer event, we encourage you to seek out the many different sessions that will be offered by the HPE DEV team. From March 28-31, you'll be able to participate virtually and attend numerous sessions on new open source and HPE technologies – from breakouts to Speaker-led (pre-registration required) and Walk-in Hands-on sessions.

**Engage directly with the HPE DEV team**

At HPE TSS 2022, you will have a couple of unique opportunities to speak directly with the HPE DEV team to hear about exciting work that's going on and to make your own voice heard. There will be two breakout sessions that cover HPE DEV activities and open source technologies ([refer to the agenda for specifics](https://h41382.www4.hpe.com/tss/application/assets/pdf/TSS22-More_About_Our_Sessions.pdf)). These tech talks are about 75 minutes long and include 20 minutes of Q&A's at the end.

In addition to the breakouts, the HPE DEV team is running a focus group.

This highly-interactive session will occur on the last day of the event, acting as a wrap up where you will get opportunities to:

* Be recognized for your achievements
* Discover our new HPE DEV Evangelists program
* View the HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand roadmaps
* Provide feedback on sessions and labs as well as on the overall HPE DEV program

**HPE DEV Hands-on Sessions**

HPE DEV will be offering two types of Hands-on Sessions at HPE TSS 2022. The Speaker-led sessions are labs where we leverage our HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand infrastructure to introduce you to some of our newest workshops. These labs require you to pre-register in order to attend. Make sure you reserve your seat today in order to learn more about:

* Securing Microservice Communication with Envoy using X.509 SPIFFE IDs
* Ansible 101
* Machine Learning 101
* Spark 101

The Walk-in sessions are also labs but they don't require pre-registration. They are handled on a first-come/first-served basis. There, you will have access to all of our existing workshops:
