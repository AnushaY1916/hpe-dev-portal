‘Autopilot’ is a concept that is familiar to many in the aviation and automobile industries. As it pertains to airplanes, autopilot systems aid pilots in focusing on crucial tasks by automating and controlling every aspect of the flight, from take-off to landing. Modern-day autopilot systems can be customized and pilots can decide on which features are to be manually controlled. Drawing parallels, in the context of Kubernetes, an autopilot system can manage the end-to-end automation of deployments as well as the maintenance of applications, relieving developers from the pain of manual intervention.  A system like this incorporates the necessary checks and balances to ensure the health of the applications and the CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) pipelines.

It’s important to note that the success of such an autopilot system relies on the extent to which developers can fine-tune and intervene in the autopilot capabilities. Just like a pilot warming up the aircraft during take-off, developers need to prepare their applications for an autopilot system to kick in. This largely depends on how the applications are structured/architected. 

In this post, I will cover autopilot systems for Kubernetes and how the combination of gopaddle and HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise enables enterprises to speed up their modernization journey. Before I do that, let me first explain the need for such systems. It all starts with a demand for efficiency of the business operations.

## Addressing the need to optimize operations

Application development has changed significantly in recent years, with the introduction of microservices, DevOps processes, and Kubernetes. Maintaining a traditional, monolithic application is arduous. It requires coordinated releases, as the entire team contributes to a single binary, which is then configured and re-configured to suit the hybrid environments it may encounter. Depending upon where the application is deployed, the application has to be configured to fit the underlying infrastructure. How you scale the application or how you react to an application’s downtime would greatly depend on where the application is being deployed and used. These sequential and tedious software releases result in sub-optimal business operations.

When businesses start adopting a microservices architecture and Kubernetes, they gain multiple benefits. A microservices architecture is nimble and gives developers the independence required to build and deploy their services as long as they conform to their API contracts. Using a microservices architecture, developers can more easily incorporate new features and ship them quickly. Kubernetes aids these agile practices by standardizing the infrastructure. Using these cloud-native technologies is a great win for  businesses, as they help them respond to the market quickly and deliver more in a short period of time.

But, even though the value of Kubernetes is apparent, implementing Kubernetes requires a huge cultural shift amongst developers. Developers are now responsible for the operational demands of how to configure and deploy their microservices and maintain those services at scale. This introduces a huge learning curve. In addition, developers end up in a cycle of maintenance and automation that, in turn, pushes them away from innovation. In other words, implementing Kubernetes can become stressful and counter-productive.

## Autopilot System for Kubernetes

The answer to this double-edged requirement of balancing business efficiency without compromising developer productivity and morale is to leverage an autopilot system for Kubernetes. Such a system should abstract the complexity across the three stages of a Kubernetes implementation.

1. **Infrastructure** — Provisioning and maintaining Kubernetes environments

2. **Application** — Deploying and maintaining applications on Kubernetes

3. **Automation** — DevOps automation, i.e., CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and alerting

HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise and gopaddle offer a combined solution that addresses these end-to-end requirements for developers.

[HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-runtime.html) provides you with an enterprise-grade container orchestration platform that is designed to run modern applications (both cloud-native and non-cloud-native monolithic applications) with persistent data.   
  
[gopaddle](https://gopaddle.io/) is a no-code platform used to build, deploy and maintain Kubernetes workloads across hybrid environments. It offers with three main capabilities: 
    
1. **Accelerate modernization** — With its intelligent scaffolding, gopaddle can transform      code into Kubernetes deployments in minutes.


2. **Increase productivity** — With its out-of-the-box tools integration and ready-to-use templates, gopaddle reduces the overhead of tedious maintenance and increases productivity.


3. **Increase operational efficiency** — gopaddle’s centralized control plane helps      provision and manage Kubernetes clusters across clouds and on-premise/edge environments.
