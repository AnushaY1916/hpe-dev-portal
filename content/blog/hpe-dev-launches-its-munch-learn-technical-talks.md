Here’s your opportunity to learn more about today’s most popular technologies and connect with some of the industry’s leading technical specialists. Held monthly by the HPE Developer Community, the HPE DEV Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where subject matter experts (SMEs) will offer valuable insights and take your questions. Each month we will be presenting a different topic, including open source, Kubernetes, and HPE Ezmeral software.

In our first session, held on January 27, 2021, Ellen Friedman, principal technologist at HPE, hosted Ted Dunning, HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric CTO, to discuss the value of data fabric and how it can run, manage, control, and secure the apps, data, and IT that run your business – from edge to cloud. Starting at a very high-level, but quickly getting into details, they explored three examples of how data fabric has been used in production at scale. Details included how these and similar systems are constructed using data fabric primitives. Ted also touched on some of the details of how the [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/data-fabric.html) works. And we had the Slack channel open for folks to pose their questions.

In keeping with the HPE DEV Community’s fun and engaging atmosphere, we shared recipes and pictures of our favorite munchies on the [\#munch-and-learn](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C01GVQUPM3P) channel of our [Slack workspace](https://slack.hpedev.io/). Attendees were able to not only get a better taste of new technologies, but were also able to benefit by being able to try out some new recipes.
