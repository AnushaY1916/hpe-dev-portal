## HPE DEV launches its Munch & Learn technical talks

Here’s your opportunity to learn more about today’s most popular technologies and connect with some of the industry’s leading technical specialists. Held monthly by the HPE Developer Community, the HPE DEV Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where subject matter experts (SMEs) will offer valuable insights and take your questions. Each month we will be presenting a different topic, ranging from using containers to develop code to how to deploy data fabrics in AI and machine learning applications. We’ll cover a variety of technologies, including open source, Kubernetes, and <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/ezmeral.html" target="_blank">HPE Ezmeral software</a>. To view this month’s topic and catch replays of previous sessions, check out our <a href="/blog/munch-and-learn" target="_blank">Munch & Learn calendar</a>.

At each monthly gathering, a technology expert is introduced by an industry luminary to the online audience. These are live sessions where you can bring questions and participate in the discussion. In keeping with the HPE DEV Community’s fun and engaging atmosphere, during each session we share recipes and pictures of our favorite munchies on the <a href="https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C01GVQUPM3P" target="_blank">#munch-and-learn channel</a> of our <a href="https://slack.hpedev.io" target="_blank">Slack workspace</a>. Attendees are able to not only get a better taste of new technologies, but are also able to benefit by being able to try out some new recipes.

## Highlights from Previous Sessions

For our first session, held on January 27, 2021, Ellen Friedman, principal technologist at HPE, hosted Ted Dunning, HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric CTO, to discuss the value of data fabric and how it can run, manage, control, and secure the apps, data, and IT that run your business – from edge to cloud. Starting at a very high-level, but quickly getting into details, they explored three examples of how data fabric has been used in production at scale. Details included how these and similar systems are constructed using data fabric primitives. Ted also touched on some of the details of how the [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/data-fabric.html) works. And we had the Slack channel open for folks to pose their questions.

You can also catch a replay of the session <a href="https://vimeo.com/507072887" target="_blank">here</a>.

During our February meetup, Nigel Poulton, Kubernetes technology author, introduced Tom Phelan, HPE Fellow and Ezmeral Software Platform CTO at HPE. They shared their thoughts on container architectures and how to leverage the Kubernetes Container Orchestrator to deploy and manage stateful, as well as microservice-based, applications. Nigel was kind enough to donate several eBooks to reward five attendees for posing excellent questions and sharing pictures of their favorite munchy.

On March 24, 2021, Ellen Friedman hosted Doug Cackett, EMEA Field CTO at HPE, who led us all in a whiteboard discussion about how data is transformed to create meaningful business value. He covered why data science was important, automating decisions, how it works in the real world using some simple examples, and some of the reasons why a data scientist might want to finesse some of the data. We look forward to bringing Doug back again at a later date to go more deeply into this discussion.  You can catch the [replay of this session](https://vimeo.com/529375709) and also review the [side chat conversations](https://developer.hpe.com/uploads/media/2021/3/munchandlearn-3-chat-1617017930299.pdf).

Daniel Feldman of HPE and Frederick Kautz of Sharecare joined us on April 21st for a discussion on how to build a foundation for zero trust using [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/), the secure production identity framework for everyone. As was pointed out, enterprise applications and other software services are increasingly running across multiple platforms spanning diverse data centers and public clouds, all in various domains. To truly secure them, many are turning to a Zero Trust model where nothing is taken for granted and every request is verified. Because Service identity and authentication is perhaps the most fundamental piece of building a Zero Trust environment, it’s important to get it right so as to not undermine later efforts to enable Zero Trust in one’s organization. Catch the replay [here](https://vimeo.com/541563205).

On May 19th, Doug Cackett, HPE EMEA Field CTO, an expert on the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform, returned to talk with us more about Data Science 101. Ellen Friedman joined as well as the session moderator, adding in interesting insights on different operational models used in the industry.
