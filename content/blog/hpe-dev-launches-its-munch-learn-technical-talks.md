## HPE DEV launches its Munch & Learn technical talks



Here’s your opportunity to learn more about today’s most popular technologies and connect with some of the industry’s leading technical specialists. Held monthly by the HPE Developer Community, the HPE DEV Munch & Learn technology talks are free, 60-minute sessions where subject matter experts (SMEs) will offer valuable insights and take your questions. Each month we will be presenting a different topic, ranging from using containers to develop code to how to deploy data fabrics in AI and machine learning applications. We’ll cover a variety of technologies, including open source, Kubernetes, and <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/ezmeral.html" target="_blank">HPE Ezmeral software</a>. To view this month’s topic and catch replays of previous sessions, check out our <a href="/blog/munch-and-learn" target="_blank">Munch & Learn calendar</a>.



At each monthly gathering, a technology expert is introduced by an industry luminary to the online audience. These are live sessions where you can bring questions and participate in the discussion. In keeping with the HPE DEV Community’s fun and engaging atmosphere, during each session we share recipes and pictures of our favorite munchies on the <a href="https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C01GVQUPM3P" target="_blank">#munch-and-learn channel</a> of our <a href="https://slack.hpedev.io" target="_blank">Slack workspace</a>. Attendees are able to not only get a better taste of new technologies, but are also able to benefit by being able to try out some new recipes.



## Highlights from Previous Sessions



For our first session, held on January 27, 2021, Ellen Friedman, principal technologist at HPE, hosted Ted Dunning, HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric CTO, to discuss the value of data fabric and how it can run, manage, control, and secure the apps, data, and IT that run your business – from edge to cloud. Starting at a very high-level, but quickly getting into details, they explored three examples of how data fabric has been used in production at scale. Details included how these and similar systems are constructed using data fabric primitives. Ted also touched on some of the details of how the [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/data-fabric.html) works. And we had the Slack channel open for folks to pose their questions.

During our February meetup, Nigel Poulton, Kubernetes technology author, introduced Tom Phelan, HPE Fellow and Ezmeral Software Platform CTO at HPE. They shared their thoughts on container architectures and how to leverage the Kubernetes Container Orchestrator to deploy and manage stateful, as well as microservice-based, applications. Nigel was kind enough to donate several eBooks to reward five attendees for posing excellent questions and sharing pictures of their favorite munchy.

## Coming Up Next



On March 24, 2021, Ellen Friedman, HPE will host Doug Cackett, EMEA Field CTO at HPE, who will start a discussion on how data is transformed to create meaningful business value. In this first of two sessions on Data Science 101, Doug will cover how Data Science operates in real-time and batch situations, AI/ML/DL taxonomy, and the value vs. volume debate. He’ll continue with more Data Science 101 primers at our May 19th, 2021 session. For our April 21 technology talk, our speakers will discuss how to build a foundation for zero trust with SPIFFE, the secure production identity framework for everyone.
