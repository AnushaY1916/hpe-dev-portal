Want to participate more in the HPE developer community but don’t know how? Have you ever dreamt about being published? Consider writing an article for the [HPE DEV blog!](https://developer.hpe.com/blog) Share your knowledge with like-minded developers, designers, data scientists, and IT admins all over the world. Maybe you’ve just discovered something new you’d like to share. Maybe you found an easier way to do something. Others in the community have probably encountered similar situations and would be eager to hear your tips. 

As daunting as it may feel, writing a blog post is not as hard as you think. The HPE DEV team has templates you can use to organize your thoughts and draft an article. You can submit your post in the way that best suits your needs. And we’re right here to help you along the way. Not confident about your writing or language skills? No worries… we even have an editor on board who can help make your article shine. Become a star blog contributor, as this post gives you all the tools you need.

## What’s the blog process?
If you’d like to be published on the HPE DEV blog, it’s really very easy. Here are the basic steps:

1. Draft your article either directly in the Netlify CMS or in one of the templates provided

2. Submit your draft for a quick technical and editorial review 

3. Make the recommended changes

4. Once approved, the article will be posted and promoted


### General guidelines
Whenever you’re writing, it’s important to remember who your audience is. Articles placed on the [HPE DEV blog](https://developer.hpe.com/blog) are seen by developers, data scientists, data architects, IT admins and managers worldwide. It is a highly technical audience who will discount anything that reeks of marketing. So, consider your topic and audience carefully. Simple advertisements for a product won’t be published. If you have any question as to the appropriateness of your topic, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:hpedev@hpe.com). 

Is there a limit on word count? Not really. You can write a post as short as 250-500 words. You can also write a much longer post. Best industry practices indicate that an ideal blog post length is between 2,100-2,400 words. If your post is very long, the editor may suggest breaking it up into a multi-part series. This often works quite well, providing you with greater visibility in the community. 

If you need to have a post published by a certain date, please let us know in advance so we can prioritize our review appropriately.

## There are two paths you can take


The HPE DEV portal is set up so you can submit your articles directly into the Netlify Content Management System (CMS) and have them reviewed by the HPE DEV team via GitHub. This is the preferred method for submitting your drafts. We also accept direct submissions of Microsoft Word or Google Docs files, in case you do not have a GitHub account or require this ability for other reasons. Templates and instructions on how to provide submissions via these documents are provided below.
