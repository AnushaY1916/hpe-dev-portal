# HPE DEV partners with SlashData for its State of the Developer Nation 2020 survey
As technologists, your world is always changing. And you want to stay on top of what’s next. To understand these trends and what is important to engineers today, [SlashData](http://slashdata.co/) runs its developer survey twice yearly. The survey is expected to reach more than 30,000 developers across 165 countries to better understand who they are, what tools they use, and where they are going next.

HPE Dev will be joining forces with SlashData as a media partner for the 20th edition of this developer survey. As Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) pivots to a software and everything-as-a-service company, the importance of understanding what really matters to developers becomes paramount. At HPE, we understand that data drives business decisions. We are encouraging all our HPE DEV Community members to take this survey and make their voices heard. 
This global, independent research is available in multiple languages and dives deeply into 12 important areas such as web, cloud, IoT, games, ML/AI, and data science. This in-depth survey may take about 20 minutes of your time, but that effort will help drive change to meet your future needs.

The survey covers programming languages and tools, skill sets, and the resources developers use. It also focuses on key technology areas, including cloud, AI, machine learning, and game development. SlashData understands your time is important and offers incentives to encourage participation, including [numerous opportunities to win prizes](https://www.developereconomics.net/prizes).

Using the data acquired through this research, SlashData produces “State of the Developer Nation” reports twice a year. You can find these free reports [here](https://www.slashdata.co/free-resources?section=subscribe). The data derived from these reports makes its way back to technology companies to address the current needs of developers around the world. You can use these reports yourself to understand how the industry continues to evolve and make the right choices for your business.

Don’t wait! This wave of the survey is only available until February 8, 2021. Although it’s promoted by several other media partners, we would grateful if you could use [our link](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=hpe) to participate in the survey because it will provide us with specific data on how we can best address your needs. Feel free to forward this link to customers, partners, colleagues and friends who might also be interested in participating.
