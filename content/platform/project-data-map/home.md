With so much data expanding exponentially at the edge, it’s challenging to find, use, manage, and share the right data, when you need it. To acquire the true meaning of your data and take action within your distributed enterprise, HPE is developing Project Data Map, which will allow you to navigate to the data you’re looking for with governance, lineage and trust. 


Project Data Map includes an open Common Metadata Framework, and correlates and scores metadata relationships derived implicitly from data usage and signals that continuously track pattern changes. This allows it to get smarter data enabling precision AI and machine learning models to make the best possible decisions.  

HPE is developing Project Data Map to:


* Democratize access to data, data analytics, and AI to domain experts, citizen users, and data scientists   


* Create a standard and open approach to meta data, enabling easier cross-vertical discovery and sharing of distributed diverse data sets   


* Use data governance of rights and conditions to improve efficiency, promote transparency, and enable business insight   


* Accelerate the data and analytics exchange   


* Reduce the extreme expense of cloud egress   


* Secure data movement from every layer of the stack, continuously and automatically  
  

* Enable a distributed enterprise to minimize unnecessary data movement for more efficient data management and help with cloud egress   

## Features

With an open source foundation and a global data fabric, like HPE Ezmeral software, Project Data Map provides seamless, unified access to distributed data and unified control of distributed Kubernetes clusters. Project Data Map features:

* A data preview browser, enabling you to see fragments of data and access its lineage to check on validity and quality.   


* Data exchange and marketplace access, providing a mechanism to publish contextual meta data to help define policy, license and exchange contracts, and provide access rights to data when criteria is met.   


* An open Common Metadata Framework that standardizes the way for you to find the most meaningful data based on personalized recommendations.   


* A data policy engine, making data sovereignty possible through dynamic policy generation and governance integrated with standard AAA services and versioned persistence on-platform and enforceable license models.   


* Data search and filter/meta data standards, automating meta data generation on ingest with the ability to provide rich meta data to describe the data and update it for personalization.   


* An Open API, allowing a service ecosystem to both consume data and orchestrate the creation of meta data for the mutual benefit of data producers and consumers.   


* Trustworthy Data Foundation, tracking and analyzing meta data from edge to core in order to shape data and pipelines with trustworthy elements throughout the entire data lifecycle.
