## Microsoft Azure in your data center

Azure Stack from Microsoft is a hybrid cloud solution that enables you to deliver Azure services from your data center. What does that mean? Well, you have an Azure cloud region running within your own data center which lets you bring modern cloud services to your sensitive data and edge applications that may not yet be suitable for the public cloud.

## Faster development with an Azure consistent environment

Since Azure Stack is an extension of Azure, the tools, APIs and development environments you use today for Azure work the same way for Azure Stack. This means you can build and deploy applications the same way for your on-premise and public Azure clouds.
