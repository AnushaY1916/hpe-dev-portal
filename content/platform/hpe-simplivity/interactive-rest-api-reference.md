Interactive REST API reference
==============================

The REST API service provides a comprehensive, intuitive, and interactive real-time reference as a web page on all Virtual Controllers that are running the REST API service. The reference describes each object type, along with the supported operations, request input parameters, response model, and response codes. Furthermore, the REST API reference provides the Try it out! option that enables you to perform REST API operations on a federation. You must log in to an HPE OmniStack host to use the Try it out! option.

To access the interactive REST API reference, obtain the IP address of a Virtual Controller in the federation that you want to manage. Then, in a web browser, navigate to the following URL:

```
 https://[Virtual Controller IP address]/api/index.html
```
