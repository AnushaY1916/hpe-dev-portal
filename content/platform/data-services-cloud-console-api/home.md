## Intro

Today, every organization are required to unleash the power of data to drive digital transformation. But fragmented data management tools, manual processes, and infrastructure silos spanning edge to cloud are getting in the way. Customers across industries are struggling with the complexity of managing data and infrastructure, because it  creates a roadblock to innovation and agility, but also drives business risk. And itâ€™s only getting harder as data continues to grow, apps continue to evolve, and infrastructure continues to spread edge-to-cloud.
