To eliminate the silos and complexity of data management and infrastructure, HPE provides the Data Services Cloud Console (DSCC), a SaaS based cloud console that delivers cloud operational agility and unified data operations as a service. Data Services Cloud Console also offers a unified API that gives developers access to infrastructure and data as code.
