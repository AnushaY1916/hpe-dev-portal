          description: The HPE Software Delivery Repository hosts dnf, yum, zypper, and apt repositories for Linux-related software packages. Much of this content is also available from various locations at hpe.com in iso or tgz format, but if you would prefer to use your Linux-native software configuration manager, you may subscribe your systems to some or all of these repositories for quick and easy access to the latest rpm/deb packages from HPE.
